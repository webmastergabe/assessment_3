        <h1>Santa Barbara</h1>

        <p>Here in Santa Barbara, every day feels like a vacation! Santa Barbara is 
        nestled between the mountains and the Pacific sea. It offers a variety of 
        activies to engage in all year long.</p>
            
        <p>You can take a stroll down <a href="https://santabarbaraca.com/explore-and-discover-santa-barbara/neighborhoods-towns/santa-barbara/downtown-santa-barbara/state-street-promenade/">State Street</a>
        , aka, the heartbeat of Santa Barbara where it is full of charming shops, 
        mouth-watering restaurants, and plenty of boutiques to spend some dough. Or you 
        can head over to the artistic disctrict: <a href="https://santabarbaraca.com/explore-and-discover-santa-barbara/neighborhoods-towns/santa-barbara/the-funk-zone/">The Funk Zone</a>. 
        Here, you will find murals, galleries, and wine-tasting rooms.</p> 

        <p> For a dose of historical culture, the <a href="https://sbcourthouse.org/">Santa Barbara Courthouse</a> 
        is a fascinating Spanish-Moorish piece of architecture that you can spend hours 
        exploring. My favorite thing here is climbing the tower for amazing panoramic 
        views of the city. Get ready for the perfect photo op!</p>

        <p> For another blast from the past, be sure to make a visit to the oldest 
        working wharf in California: <a href="https://stearnswharf.org/">Stearns Wharf</a>. 
        You can stroll down the pier while enjoying the salty breeze, and if you're 
        lucky, you may catch some playful dolphins jumping through the waves as the deep-
        sea fishers try to get lucky with a catch.</p>

        <p>And of course, the beaches! You can surf the perfect wave at Rincon Point or 
        soak up the sun at <a href="https://www.santabarbara.com/activities/beaches/santa-barbara/east-beach/">East Beach</a>
        , Santa Barbara's coastline is full of beauty.</p>
